## Science Concepts

---

### Hypothesis

Hypothesis are an extremely important part of the scientific method. A hypothesis is typically referred to as an
"educated guess" of what will happen.

During this term I made a hypothesis that being on my phone for less amount of time before bed would increase
the amount of sleep I got in a night because of reduced blue light exposure.

### Systems and Models
Sytems and Models play a huge role in our understanding of how complex biological organisms work. For example,
during the term, we have broken down the human body into many smaller systems in order to understand how our
larger systems work.
